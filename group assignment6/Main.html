                        <p> Yoga is a holistic practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation techniques. 
                            It promotes flexibility, balance, relaxation, and mental well-being. Through a series of asanas (poses) and pranayama (breathing exercises), yoga helps improve physical strength and flexibility while fostering inner peace and mindfulness. 
                            It's a versatile practice that can be tailored to individuals of all fitness levels, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced practitioners alike.</p>
